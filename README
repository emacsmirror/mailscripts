mailscripts -- collection of scripts for manipulating e-mail on Unixes
======================================================================

This package is a place to collect together, and distribute, small scripts for
manipulating e-mail on Unixes.  The idea is that those of us handling our
e-mail using tools like offlineimap, mbsync, notmuch, mu, mairix etc. often
end up writing small helper scripts, and some of the scripts are worth tidying
up, documenting and sharing with others, but they're small enough not to
deserve packages of their own.  This is a place for them.

mailscripts is primarily developed as part of the Debian project.  In July
2018 some notmuch-using Debian Developers arrived at the DebCamp preceding
DebConf18, and started discussing useful mail-handling scripts, actual and
envisioned.  We decided it would be a good idea to create a package like this.
If you have written a useful mail-handling script, please consider submitting
it to this collection.

Some highlights:

* mdmv -- safely move messages between maildirs

* mbox2maildir -- convert an mbox to a maildir using Python's libraries

* notmuch-extract-patch -- extract a git patch series from notmuch

* email-print-mime-structure -- tree view of a message's MIME structure

* imap-dl -- download messages from an IMAP mailbox to a maildir

mailscripts.el -- Emacs utilities for handling mail on Unixes
=============================================================

mailscripts.el is an Emacs Lisp library.  It's original purpose was to make it
easy to use scripts shipped in Debian's mailscripts package from within Emacs.
It now also contains additional, thematically-related utilities which don't
invoke any of those scripts.

Some highlights:

* notmuch-extract-{thread,message}-patches{,-to-project}
  -- extract & apply git patch(es) from Gnus+notmuch or notmuch-show

* mailscripts-git-format-patch-drafts
  -- import patches generated by git-format-patch(1) to Gnus or notmuch drafts

* mailscripts-git-format-patch-attach
  -- compose mail with patches generated by git-format-patch(1) attached
     (Git-specific alternative to the built-in vc-prepare-patches)

* mailscripts-git-format-patch-append
  -- append an inline "-- >8 --" patch to an unsent message
