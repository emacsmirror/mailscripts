email-print-mime-structure - display a tree-like view of the MIME structure of an e-mail

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<email-print-mime-structure> <B<message.eml>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<email-print-mime-structure> reads a MIME message from stdin and
produces a treelike representation to stdout.

If the user wants the parts numbered, they can feed the output through
something like "cat -n".


=head1 OPTIONS

None.

=head1 EXAMPLE

=over 4

    $ email-print-mime-structure <test.eml

     └─╴application/pgp-signature inline [signature.asc] 836 bytes

=head1 LIMITATIONS

B<email-print-mime-structure> currently does not try to decrypt
encrypted e-mails, so it cannot display the MIME structure that is
inside the message's cryptographic envelope.

B<email-print-mime-structure>'s output is not stable, and is not
intended to be interpreted by machines, so please do not depend on it
in scripts!

B<email-print-mime-structure> displays some data from within the
e-mail, but does not sanitize it before display.  Some particularly
cleverly-malformed MIME parameters might be able to induce apparent
formatting changes or emit arbitrary characters to stdout.

B<email-print-mime-structure> expects to be run in a UTF-8-friendly
environment.
